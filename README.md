# Temporal

A lightweight spec-compliant [Temporal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal) polyfill in addition to other jsnext date utilities.

## Installation

Before building anything:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

(don't do recursive)

## TODO

- since `build` command doesn't generate .d.ts files anymore, have a one-time watch script (dev?)
- convert all script/(lib) to cjs
- exclude submodules dirs from searches in vscode
- add ruler in vscode settings
